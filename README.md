# ActiveLearning_run_dir_cookiecutter
Cookiecutter template to generate the directory structure needed for runs

# To generate a run directory structure
1. Clone this directory
2. Install `cookiecutter` (say, `pip install -U cookiecutter`)
3. run `python -m cookiecutter <this directory>`

This should ask you a bunch of questions and generate the directory under `al_dataset_runs`
